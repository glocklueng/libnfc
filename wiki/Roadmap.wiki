#summary Waht's cooking for the nex *libnfc* releases.

= libnfc-1.4 =

The aim of this release is to stabilise the current libnfc infrastructure.  The library has grown quite hard recently but a few things are prone to long-term issues. In order to avoid posteponing an update of the libnfc, we focus on polishing the code and implementing better error management before releasing a 1.4 stable release.

ETA: september 2010

= libnfc-1.6 =

The focus for 1.6 is a better abstraction of NFC devices.  As of 1.3.x, we already have concepts of drivers and chips, but the overall architecture is pn53x-centric, and while there is no plan to support any other chip at the time of writing, this could became a major issue when we will decide to do so.  It has so been decided to rework the way NFC devices are handled and provide a device agnostic and consistent API for NFC targets manipulation

ETA: TBD

= libnfc-1.8 =

Nothing discussed yet.  I guess there is a log of nfc-ip stuff here.

ETA: TBD
